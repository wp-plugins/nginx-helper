== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= FAQ - Installation/Comptability =

**Q. Will this work out of the box?**

No. You need to make some changes at Nginx end. Please check **tutorial list** of [Description tab](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nginx-helper/)

= FAQ - Nginx Map =

**Q. On my Multisite, I am alredy using `WPMU_ACCEL_REDIRECT`. Do I still need Nginx Map?**

Definietly yes. `WPMU_ACCEL_REDIRECT` reduceds load on PHP, but it still ask WordPress i.e. PHP/MySQL to do some work for static files e.g. images in your post. Nginx map handles files by itself which gives you much better performance without using a CDN.

For any page on your site, try purging cache manullay for it, by following instructions mentioned in next answer.

**Q. I need to flush a cached page immediately! How do I do that?**

Nginx helper plugin try to handle all common cases when you need to purge a cached copy of page. e.g. a post is edited, a comment is approved on a post, etc.

If you come across any URL like `http://example.com/hello-world/' you can simply 'purge' before path-part of URL.
It will become like `http://example.com/purge/hello-world/'
Just open in browser and cache for `/hello-world/` will be flushed immeditaley!


= FAQ - Nginx Map =

**Q. I am using X plugin. Will it work on Nginx?**

Most likely yes. A wordpress plugin, if not using explictly any Apache-only mod, should work on Nginx. Some plugin may need some extra work.
